  #
  # A playbook to handle bootstrapping the node with local administrators.  This
  # should be the first thing executed on all new nodes.  You will have to specify
  # the three variables:
  #
  #  - bootstrap_host - the targeted host
  #  - bootstrap_user - typically the 'root' user
  #  - bootstrap_password - the password to login as the bootstrap_user
  #
  # After this playbook is executed, the rest of your provisioning can occur as
  # a user with sudo privileges.
  #
